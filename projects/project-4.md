summary: Final project in ICS 314.
---

For our final project my team and I have decided to create a study application. This would allow people in the ICS department to create sessions where they can collaborate with others to help learn the material. This application features a leaderboard and will help encourage people to want to go to these sessions. We also created an admin page where the admin is able to view the session and delete if need be. 

My contribution to this project was creating the landing page, calendar page, and couple touch ups to the overall work. The landing page has featured a preview system that will show the events that are upcomings sessions with sessions that are happening today. With the calendar page I had to find a design pattern online to use so putting the calendar wasnâ€™t too hard but had a bit of trouble with the linking sessions in our collection.

Overall this was an eye opening experience. It really helped me understand working with a group to make a functional application. It also helps me understand how working through github can actually be pretty simple. I really enjoyed the project board feature where we are able to see what people are working on. All these functions were really cool to work with.This help be better my understanding with software development as a whole.
