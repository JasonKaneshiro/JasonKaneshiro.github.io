## Templates for Code ...
When it comes to hard questions or problems that we face in life we often have many ways of thinking about it. We can go with the obvious answer where it may be easy but we will get it done or we could take the un-practical way and stand out. But there are problems where there is one solution that we would use. Like typing an essay like this one we would go to google docs or word and start typing away. Just like design patterns we use this as a template. We have the options to use rough outlines that are present to problems that a lot of people have. Examples of this are in docs we can pick from templates like MLA to style your paper in the MLA format, or a report that has to have a cover page and many more. For software developers this is known as design patterns which are pretty much these templates for solving similar problems that will help you structure your solution. Let say you are making a web application that will have multiple profiles on one page you would be able to find a design pattern to help you with this. Even though we know that there would be different things going on in the web application we can still use the profiles form the design pattern to help us with the profiles.

## I did what now... 
Throughout this class we were using design patterns without even knowing about it. I went assignment by assignment using the template to help complete them. This is only the start of it. Now we are on the final project which stemmed from the meteor template that had many components that we were going to use for this project. I even had to create a calendar application that I used a template I found online. This just shows how important it is to have these design patterns laying around so people like me can find them and use them for our personal projects.
