## The Standard ...

The “coding standards” what is a standard and why do we need to follow this standard. These are the questions that popped up when I first heard of this. But just like essays or a recipe there is a way you should write it. There are many ways to write it and it depends on what you want to do. So it’s just like with code this was what I thought this was. This makes the code easy to read and see what is happening and making it easier to understand. This is mostly due to the spacing that the coding standard forces you to put. This is all great and all but when typing the code … it's a all new problem.

Don’t get me wrong I do feel that this is just something that I need to get used to but currently having a constant reminder that something is wrong gets to me. It's like having someone watch over your shoulder watch your every input and letting you know that you are missing something. This forces me to be more mindful about my spacing and how my code looks. This is also useful finding where these problems are. This skill will come with time and will help me in the future.

Overall these coding standards are in place to help everyone have a more uniform look when It comes to different coders.It may be annoying at first but at the end it’s totally worth the pain. This is important because when sharing code or working on code together it makes it look clean and easy to read/understand what is going on. These are my expectations with the coding standards and what I feel so far. I know that in the future looking back I will be glad that I have started this practice early.
